# Changelog

All notable changes to `com.ponyudev.sherpa-onnx` will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-10

Runtime API surface revamp, on-disk profile management overhaul, and a unified sample scene. Driven by the items Android testing surfaced during the cycle.

### Added

- **`ProfileReadyEvent` semantic init API** on every service (TTS / offline ASR / online ASR / VAD). `InitializeAsync(Action<ProfileReadyEvent>, ct)` reports Download / DownloadRetrying / Extract / Init / Ready / Failed phases, each with its own 0..100 percent. Unified-bar weighting documented in the runtime-usage guides.
- **`RemoteProfileFetcher`** — runtime download of `.zip` / `.tar.gz` / `.tar.bz2` model archives via `UnityWebRequest + DownloadHandlerFile` + SharpZipLib. Streams archives straight to disk (no managed `byte[]`), 3 retries with exponential backoff, marker keyed by SHA-1 of the URL.
- **Per-profile lazy extraction on Android** for `Local` / `Remote` / `LocalZip` sources — every source lands at the same `persistentDataPath/SherpaOnnx/<service>-models/<profileName>/`, and only the active profile's group is materialised on first `LoadProfile`.
- **`IModelDiskUsage`** on every service: `GetExtractedProfiles()`, `GetExtractedProfileSizeBytes(name)`, `TryDeleteExtractedProfile(name)`, `CleanupUnusedExtractedProfiles()`.
- **`keepOnlyActiveProfile`** runtime flag + Project Settings toggle. After every successful Initialize / SwitchProfile, removes every registered profile's extracted directory except the active one.
- **`buildOnlyActiveProfile`** Editor-build flag — strips non-active profile model files (and LocalZip archives) out of StreamingAssets before manifest generation, so the produced build ships only the active profile. Implies `keepOnlyActiveProfile` at runtime.
- **`SwitchProfileAsync(int|string, ct)`** on every service — runs the native engine ctor on the thread pool so the UI thread stays free during the multi-second sherpa-onnx ctor. Re-emits `ProfileReadyEvent` (Init / Ready / Failed) through the cached callback.
- **`IsProfileAvailable(string)`** on every service — picker UIs can hide profiles whose model files are not reachable on the current platform.
- **`MainThreadDispatcher`** (public, `Runtime/Common/Platform/`) — captures Unity's main-thread `SynchronizationContext` once at startup and exposes `Post(...)`. Any consumer wiring UI to `ProfileReadyEvent` from worker threads gets a thread-safe primitive without rolling its own capture.
- **Unified `Samples~/Demo/SherpaOnnxDemo.unity`** — single scene with a top-level menu, three per-module sub-menus, and a per-module profile-picker dropdown that filters through `IsProfileAvailable`. Replaces the three previous sample scenes.
- TTS / ASR / VAD runtime-usage guides updated with the new event API, disk-management semantics, and async switch / availability APIs.

### Changed

- Models from any source (`Local` / `Remote` / `LocalZip`) now share `persistentDataPath/SherpaOnnx/<service>-models/<profileName>/` on Android. Disk-usage APIs treat all three the same.
- `StreamingAssetsCopier` streams files via `DownloadHandlerFile` — no managed `byte[]` is materialised, so 100 MB+ models do not spike GC or OOM low-memory devices. Partial files are removed on cancel / HTTP error.
- Native engine load offloaded to the thread pool — UI no longer freezes at 99% on Android while loading large models.
- In Editor, any non-Local profile is treated as Local — `ProfileSourceResolver` short-circuits and the path resolvers route every source to StreamingAssets, so PlayMode does not re-download or re-unpack archives on every iteration.
- `BZip2InputStream` reads through a `BufferedStream(64 KB)` so SharpZipLib's small-chunk reads do not dominate wall-clock on Android external storage. tar.bz2 extraction emits compressed-bytes progress (throttled to ~4/s) plus per-32-MB info logs.
- `*InitProgressBus` (sample) `IsReady` / `IsFailed` flipped from sticky-after-first-event to current-phase — a recovered switch clears the previous Failed state.
- `RemoteProfileFetcher.StripSingleTopLevelFolder` mirrors `tar --strip-components=1` for archives wrapped under a single top-level directory.

### Fixed

- Android voice capture coexistence with TTS — `AudioSessionBridge` configures `AudioManager.MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` + speakerphone on Android and switches `AVAudioSession` between `PlayAndRecord` / `Playback` on iOS.
- TTS on IL2CPP — falls back to callback-less `Generate(...)` because sherpa-onnx's chunk callback wraps user delegates as instance methods, which IL2CPP cannot marshal.
- Microphone resampling on Android devices that return native sample rates regardless of the requested 16 kHz; `Linear` and `Lowpass` algorithms selectable.
- `tar.bz2` / `tar.gz` / `zip` extractors rethrow exceptions instead of swallowing them — `RemoteProfileFetcher` no longer stamps a marker on an empty directory and the native engine no longer crashes on missing model files.
- Cross-thread bus events crashed UI Toolkit set-`value` calls. `MainThreadDispatcher` marshals the `Changed` event onto the main thread.
- `RemoteProfileFetcher` validates that the marker is paired with at least one non-marker file before reusing a cached extraction.
- Concurrent profile-switch / engine-use races (sherpa-onnx native ctor is not thread-safe). Each service gates every API entry point on a `volatile bool _isSwitching`; `TtsService` also rotates `_serviceCts` so in-flight `GenerateAsync` is cancelled before the new engine ctor starts.
- Sample sub-menu status label stayed frozen after `SwitchProfile` — services now cache the `InitializeAsync` callback and re-emit Ready / Failed from `SwitchProfile` / `SwitchProfileAsync`.

### Removed

- Three per-module sample scenes (`Samples~/{TTS,ASR,VAD}/`) — replaced by the unified `Samples~/Demo/SherpaOnnxDemo.unity`.
- `autoDeletePreviousProfile` setting — replaced by the more general `keepOnlyActiveProfile`.

### Breaking

- Service interfaces: `InitializeAsync(IProgress<float>)` → `InitializeAsync(Action<ProfileReadyEvent>)`. Mechanical migration: replace `new Progress<float>(p => …)` with `e => …` and switch on `e.Phase`.
- `*SettingsData.autoDeletePreviousProfile` → `keepOnlyActiveProfile`. Pure rename — `*Settings.asset` files lose the old value on first re-serialise; re-tick the box if the flag was set.
- `ITtsService` / `IAsrService` / `IOnlineAsrService` / `IVadService` gain three new members: `SwitchProfileAsync(int, ct)`, `SwitchProfileAsync(string, ct)`, `IsProfileAvailable(string)`. External implementers must add them.
- Sample directory: `Samples~/{TTS,ASR,VAD}/` removed; `Samples~/Demo/` is the only sample. Update any scripts that hard-coded the old paths.
